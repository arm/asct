CMN System Investigation Tools
==============================

These tools help developers understand system performance on
systems based on Arm&reg;'s CoreLink&trade; CMN family interconnects
(CMN-600, CMN-650, CMN-700, CI-700 etc.).

The tools are aimed at developers of complex multithreaded
applications and middleware, and at system administrators and
others who need to understand whole-node performance. Some tools
give deeper insights into CMN configuration and activity, and are
aimed at system bringup and debugging, including in pre-silicon
(emulation and FPGA) environments through the use of JTAG debug.

When run self-hosted, the tools generally assume root privilege,
and direct access to a server or a "metal" instance.

Tools are provided to:

 - discover the CMN mesh topology and record it in a JSON file

 - discover the mapping of Linux CPUs to mesh nodes, correctly
   handling CALs, clusters and chip-to-chip variation

 - visualize the mesh topology as a 2-D diagram

 - construct PMU event specifiers (including complex watchpoints)
   for use with "perf" tools

 - collect histograms and metrics to understand system traffic
   behaviors associated with common scenarios

 - dump and interpret CMN configuration registers

 - trace requests, responses and snoops, using either on-chip FIFOs
   or an external trace unit

The tools are written in Python. Any recent version of
Python3 should be sufficient. Some tools may work with Python2.

All scripts are in the "src" subdirectory. No package installation
step is required and there are no third-party dependencies.


System discovery and setup
==========================

Some of the tools need a system topology description, to
identify the specific configuration, topology and CPU locations
for your system. This may already be available for your system.
If not, it can be created using the discovery tools (see below),
including cmn_discover.py and cmn_detect_cpu.py .

The default location for this file in your home directory is:

    ~/.cache/arm/cmn-system.json

Discovery scripts and other tools will create, update or use
this file as appropriate.


Creating the topology description file
--------------------------------------
This step should only need to be done once, but needs a
significant level of system privilege. See README-discovery.md.


Visualizing a CMN interconnect
------------------------------

The interconnect can be visualized as a text diagram. Run:

    python cmn_diagram.py

This will print a text diagram like this:

              0c:RN-D              2c:RN-D              4c:RN-F:#0,#1        6c:SN-F
             /                    /                    /                    /
            08(0,1)--------------28(1,1)--------------48(2,1)--------------68(3,1)
           /|                   /|                   /|                   /|
    08:RN-D |            28:HN-F |            48:HN-F |            68:HN-D |
            |                    |                    |                    |
            | 04:RN-D            | 24:HN-F            | 44:HN-F            | 64:SBSX
            |/                   |/                   |/                   |/
            00(0,0)--------------20(1,0)--------------40(2,0)--------------60(3,0)
           /                    /                    /                    /
    00:CXRH        20:RN-F:#2,#3              40:RN-D              60:SN-F


Recap - discovering the mesh topology
-------------------------------------

Let's recap the CMN discovery process:

    sudo python cmn_discover.py
    python cmn_detect_cpu.py
    python cmn_diagram_py

If this succeeds, you should have a cached CMN configuration file in
``~/.cache/arm/cmn-system.json``, and a diagram of the mesh will
appear on the console.

If problems occur see the "troubleshooting" section.


Top-down performance analysis
-----------------------------

Top-down performance analysis aims at finding the significant
contributors to system bandwidth.  It analyzes system usage, rather
than specific applications.

The ``cmn_topdown.py`` script provides several levels of top-down
performance analysis, using CMN PMU events.  Currently three
levels are featured:

 - Level 1 identifies which requesters are dominant (CPU vs. I/O)

 - Level 2, for multi-die or multi-socket systems, measures local
   versus remote access

 - Level 3 further characterizes memory accesses into system
   cache hits and misses.

The exact process of top-down analysis may vary across different
systems, depending on CMN version and configuration.

Top-down analysis is currently at an experimental stage and will
be significantly enhanced in upcoming releases of these tools.


Constructing CHI watchpoint strings for perf
--------------------------------------------

If the Linux CMN PMU driver is installed, CMN perf events are
available through the ``perf_event_open`` interface and the ``perf``
userspace tools. These should be sufficient for many purposes.

In some cases it may be useful to construct CMN watchpoints to
match and count certain types of interconnect traffic. This generally
requires some level of knowledge of the CHI architecture.
The ``cmnwatch.py`` script can be used to generate strings that
match CHI flits. The strings can be passed to the ``perf`` command.

    perf stat -e `python cmnwatch.py up:req:opcode=Evict` ...

will expand into one or more CMN ``watchpoint_up`` events,
that will count all flits (interconnect packets) matching the
selected fields.

Watchpoints can refer to a subset of CHI fields. Not all fields
can be matched.

Some field combinations may requiring simultaneous matching on
two watchpoint filters, using CMN's watchpoint combination feature.
``cmnwatch.py`` will automatically use the ``wp_combine``
attribute in this case. For example,

    perf stat -e `python cmnwatch.py up:req:opcode=ReadNoSnp:memattr=0bx00x`

will match on opcode and memory attributes. These are in filter
groups 0 and 1 respectively, so a combination watchpoint is needed.


Capturing CHI traffic
---------------------

Watchpoints can also be used to capture CHI packet headers for
analysis, and a tool ``cmn_capture.py`` is provided. For more
details see README-capture.md .

To capture multiple CHI packets involved in a single transaction,
showing latency (in cycles) between different packets, use
the ``cmn_latency.py`` tool. For more details see README-latency.md .


Offline inspection using a dump file
------------------------------------

When inspecting CMN configuration in detail, it may be more convenient
to capture the CMN state from the target and then run scripts on a
different machine. The CMN tools support this:

    ./cmn_devmem.py --dump

will create a register dump file on standard output. Other CMN inspection
tools can then use this by specifying the dump file in the environment:

    CMN_DUMP=<dumpfile> ./cmn_list.py --cmn-base=<addr>

Note that in general it will be necessary to specify the CMN base address.


Troubleshooting
===============

It is difficult to cover all possible problems that might be
encountered, but we can cover some common issues:

 - the system might not be based on an Arm CMN interconnect.
   ``cmn_discover.py`` will report this.

 - the kernel may have been built with CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=y.
   This will prevent direct access to CMN device space, including
   CMN topology discovery and packet capture. It may be possible
   to gain access by unloading the kernel PMU driver with
   "rmmod arm-cmn", which releases kernel access to CMN device space.

 - the Linux CMN PMU driver might not be installed and enabled.
   Check for ``/sys/devices/arm_cmn_0``. (A future version of this
   guide might explain how to enable the CMN PMU driver.)

 - insufficient privilege to see CMN PMU events. Try this:
   ``sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0``

 - due to security settings, some systems do not provide
   visibility of the RSP and DAT channels in the interconnect.
   Some use cases for advanced watchpoints will not be
   available.

Please also see ``TODO.md`` which lists some known limitations that
may be addressed in future releases.
