CMN watchpoint configuration

Copyright (C) Arm Ltd. 2024. All rights reserved.
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

The basic idea is to take a set of named CHI packet fields, e.g.
  opcode=..., srcid=...
and return a watchpoint configuration as a 64-bit value/mask pair,
that can be passed to a perf command or perf_event_open call.
In some cases two value/mask pairs must be used, and the caller will
combine these with the 'combine' attribute when passing to perf.

The value/mask pairs can also be used when programming CMN
watchpoints directly, e.g. via /dev/mem.

The mapping of fields to masks depends on product version (600, 700 etc.)
and may also depend on product configuration (e.g. MPAM enabled).

This script is designed as a module, but can also be used as a
command-line tool to construct a watchpoint expression for "perf".
