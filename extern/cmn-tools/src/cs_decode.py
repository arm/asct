CoreSight trace decoding.

This module handles the overall processing of a combined CoreSight trace
stream which may interleave trace from multiple sources (e.g. ETMs, STMs etc.).
It doesn't handle the decode of actual stream formats, but hands off data
to decoders for these formats.  You call it something like this:

  import cs_decode, cs_decode_etm
  decoders = {1: cs_decode_etm.decode_etm()}
  cs_decode.stream_decode(stream, decoders)

In general the CoreSight trace decode pipeline consists of a
number of steps:

  - remove any 4-byte frame sync packets
  - synchronize to 16-byte frame boundaries (assumed already done)
  - find first trace stream identifier (indicated by LSB=1 in even bytes)
  - align to packet boundary for each stream (stream-specific sync packet)
    - for ETM/PFT this is A-sync
  - recover enough context to successfully decode stream (stream-specific)
    - for ETM/PFT this is I-sync, and possibly CONTEXTID

References:

[CSA] CoreSight Architecture Specification v2.0

In this module and elsewhere in the trace decoder, various techniques
are used for streams of data.

  - file-like objects (FLOs) which respond to read(n) requests

  - generators which yield bytes, packets, frames etc.

  - consumers which accept bytes or packets
